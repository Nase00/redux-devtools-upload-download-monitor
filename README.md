# Redux DevTools Upload/Download Monitor

A monitor for [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) to enable uploading and downloading of serialized application states.

Credit to [Redux Import Export Monitor](https://github.com/lapanoid/redux-import-export-monitor) for inspiration. The goal of this monitor is to emulate similar functionality, but in a way that works with very large application states.
